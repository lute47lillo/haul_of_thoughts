PostgreSQL DB documentation

During the Postgres installation, an operating system user named postgres 
was created to correspond to the postgres PostgreSQL administrative user. 
You need to use this user to perform administrative tasks. You can use 
sudo and pass in the username with the -iu option.

1. Or you can start the PostgreSQL server and have it start up at login automatically
    brew services start postgresql
2. To make it stop starting up automatically at login
    brew services stop postgresql

3. Restart
    brew services restart postgresql

4. Console
    psql postgres
    \l -> list tables
    \c book_db -> connect to db

5. To exit \q

FUTURE FEATURES to be ADDED

    1. LogIn/LogOut 
        - Normal auth
        - Biometric auth
        - Will it require a new DB? Or should I connect the user DB to the auth?

    2. Book Recomendation implementation
        - Fully featured
        - String matching for similar look ups (Due to rigid dataset)
        - Filter by own recomendations

    3. Feed route (HOME)
        - Show your latest thoughts
        - Show your list of book thougts
        - Share with friends

    4. User data
        - Create lists of thoughts based on author, theme or other variable
        - Create lists of finished books and TO READ list
            - Imported from Book recomendation
            - Just added (How to deal with incomplete data? -> Maybe importing from dataset?)

    5. Book thought (User view)
        - Get cover picture to easily identify book
        - Create Personal thought view where data is displayed and showed completely, and can be edited on site (without form look)
        - Compact the data shown on whole list of thoughts, display full when functionality above clicked.

    REALLY FAR IN THE FUTURE FEATURES

    6. Connect DB to cloud to retrieve anywhere

    7. Host application somewhere so it doesn't run locally.

    8. Create web-browser phone look for the app. 
    
    9. Create iPhone application based on the web app. (More like a social place)
        - This could also create reading groups, where there is an asynchronous timeline to read and share thoughts, theories
          and ideas.
